# PBL_Driver_In_The_Loop

Project made by Silesian University of Technology and Sun Moon University students. 

## Project description

General goal of the project is to prepare a model of a stand for vehicle motion simulation. The considered approach to testing of vehicle systems called driver-in-the-loop
simulator allows the driver to be included in validation procedure and to influence the tested vehicle systems and dynamics. The scaled model of the vehicle will be a key element of the prepared driver’s test stand. Orientation of the vehicle will be adjusted in pitch and roll axis using two servos while wheels of the vehicle will be driven by a DC motor, and checking the instantaneous vehicle position using an accelerometer and a gyroscope. The state of the scaled vehicle will be linked with the vehicle model simulated using a Carla simulator. The Carla simulation environment is a flexible and modular simulation server for development of algorithms for autonomous vehicles, based on Unreal Engine. Such environment allows for simulation and visualization of vehicle dynamics as well as for control of selected parameters of the simulated city and vehicles using clients created in Python. Additionally speed of the vehicle model simulated in Carla environment will be controlled by additional buttons included in the designed setup.

## What is used in our project

- Carla simulator set up on PC
- ROS (Robot Operating System) with Ubuntu as the supported operating system
- Raspberyy Pi 4
- Python, C++ (probably)
- Catia 3DExperience
